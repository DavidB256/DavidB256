Hello! I’m David Bass, a third year undergraduate Echols Scholar at the University of Virginia working towards a B.S. in statistics, a B.A. in mathematics, and minors in biology and Spanish.

I’m interested in computational genomics, protein structure prediction, mathematical statistics, education, and everything in between.

I'm currently researching microscale patterns in E. coli evolution with computational genomics techniques with the Wu Lab.
