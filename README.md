Hello! I’m David Bass, a third year undergraduate Echols Scholar at the University of Virginia working towards a B.S. in statistics, a B.A. in mathematics, and a minor in Spanish.

I’m interested in mathematical statistics, protein modeling, bioinformatics, education, and everything in between.

I'm currently working on ProtKit, a suite of tools for working with protein structure files.
