Hello! I’m David Bass, a third year undergraduate Echols Scholar at the University of Virginia studying mathematics and statistics.
I’m interested in mathematical statistics, protein modeling, bioinformatics, education, and everything in between.
I'm currently working on ProtKit, a suite of tools for working with protein structure files.
Reach me via email at djb3ve@virginia.edu or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-bass-586131190/.
